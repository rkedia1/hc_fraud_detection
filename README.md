# hc_fraud_detection
#This repository contains code for a healthcare fraud detection system. The system uses machine learning models to identify potential instances of fraud in healthcare insurance claims.

## Data

The dataset used for this project includes beneficiary data, inpatient data, outpatient data, and labels indicating potential fraud. This data is Kaggle-sourced.

## Installation

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rkedia1/healthcare-fraud-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd healthcare-fraud-detection`
3. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Models

Three machine learning models are trained for fraud detection in this system:

1. XGBoost Classifier
2. LightGBM Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
